          # The command for production deployment differs slightly:
          # No --branch flag, or explicitly --branch=main
          # Ensure your `pages:deploy:production` script handles this or use the command directly.
          # If your npm script `pages:deploy:production` is already set up for production, use that:
          # command: npm run pages:deploy:production
          # Otherwise, be explicit:
          command: pages deploy ./dist --project-name=properaccount --branch=main
